    <h2>History of AI</h2>
    <p>
      The concept of artificial intelligence has its roots in ancient history, where myths and legends described intelligent automatons and mechanical beings.
      In the 20th century, the field of AI began formally with the work of Alan Turing, who proposed the idea of a machine that could simulate human intelligence.

      The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, where leading scientists discussed the possibility of creating intelligent machines.
      Over the decades, AI has gone through periods of intense progress and "AI winters" â€” times of reduced funding and interest.

      Today, AI is widely used in various domains including healthcare, finance, and transportation, driven by advances in machine learning, big data, and computing power.
