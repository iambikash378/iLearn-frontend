    <h2>Ethics in AI</h2>
    <p>
      As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, ethical concerns have taken center stage in the discussion of their development and deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key ethical issues include:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bias and Fairness:</strong> AI can perpetuate or even amplify human biases if not properly addressed.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Data used to train AI must be handled securely and responsibly.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Users should understand how AI systems make decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Developers must take responsibility for the consequences of AI behavior.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethical AI requires collaboration between technologists, policymakers, and the public to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared broadly and fairly.
