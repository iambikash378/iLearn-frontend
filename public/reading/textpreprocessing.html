    <h2>Text Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>
      Text preprocessing is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) that prepares raw text data for analysis.
      It involves several steps to clean, normalize, and structure the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common preprocessing tasks include:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lowercasing:</strong> Converting all text to lowercase for uniformity.</li>
        <li><strong>Removing punctuation:</strong> Cleaning symbols that donâ€™t add meaning.</li>
        <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Splitting text into words or phrases.</li>
        <li><strong>Stopword removal:</strong> Removing common words like "the", "and", "is".</li>
        <li><strong>Stemming/Lemmatization:</strong> Reducing words to their base form.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Proper text preprocessing improves model accuracy and efficiency in NLP applications like sentiment analysis, text classification, and chatbots.
