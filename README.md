# iLearn : Learning Platform 
This is a personal project where I aim to build a full-stack online learning application. This is inspired from popular MOOC Platforms like Coursera, EdX, Udacity and Udemy.
The frontend uses HTML, CSS, ReactJS and some MaterialUI.
The backend uses NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.

The project is still ongoing.
